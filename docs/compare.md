# Compare

## What it does
Compare lets you A/B source vs processed versions with synced playback, waveform/spectrogram views, and loudness overlays.

## When to use it
- Validate cleanup and mastering results.
- Check loudness and dynamics changes.

## Step-by-step
1) Open Compare.
2) Select a source and a processed version.
3) Use Waveform or Spectrogram view.
4) Toggle Both/Source/Processed to evaluate changes.

## Common pitfalls
- If Match Loudness is on and audio is silent, toggle it off and on again.
- If overlays look misaligned, reset zoom to 1x.

## Tips
- Use Overview scrubber for quick navigation.
- Use spectrogram mode to spot hiss and harshness.

## TODO
- Add overlay definitions and thresholds.
