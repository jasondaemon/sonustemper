# SonusTemper Documentation

## Overview
SonusTemper is a music finishing toolkit for AI‑generated and real recordings. It focuses on safe, fast cleanup and mastering workflows with a song‑centric library and version tracking.

## Quick start
1) Import or select a song from the Library.
2) Use a utility (AI Toolkit, Noise Removal, EQ) to make changes.
3) Save a copy to create a new version.
4) Use Compare to check source vs version.

## Common pitfalls

- If playback is silent, verify audio is not blocked by the browser and that the AudioContext is running.

## Tips
- Use the Library as the source of truth for all work.
- Prefer versioned saves instead of overwriting files.

## TODO
- Add screenshots for each workflow.
- Add key shortcuts reference.
