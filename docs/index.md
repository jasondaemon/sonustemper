## What it does
SonusTemper is a music finishing toolkit for AI‑generated and real recordings. It focuses on safe, fast cleanup and mastering workflows with a song‑centric library and version tracking.

## When to use it
- You need to clean up a track (Noise Removal, EQ, AI Toolkit).
- You want A/B comparison between versions.
- You need consistent mastering across multiple tracks.

## Quick start
1) Import or select a song from the Library.
2) Use a utility (AI Toolkit, Noise Removal, EQ) to make changes.
3) Save a copy to create a new version.
4) Use Compare to check source vs version.
5) Run Mastering to finalize.

> **Note:** Every save creates a version in the Library; your source stays intact.

## Common pitfalls
- If you do not see a file, refresh the Library or check the import path.
- If playback is silent, verify the browser allowed audio playback and the AudioContext is running.

## Tips
- Use the Library as the source of truth for all work.
- Prefer versioned saves instead of overwriting files.
