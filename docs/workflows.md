## What it does
Recommended end‑to‑end workflows for cleaning and mastering songs.

## When to use it
- You want a consistent sequence from source to final master.

## Step-by-step
1) Import or select source in Library.
2) Run AI Toolkit for quick cleanup.
3) Use Noise Removal for targeted fixes.
4) Use EQ for tonal shaping.
5) Save versions after each step.
6) Compare source vs latest version.
7) Run Mastering and save final output.

## Common pitfalls
- Skipping version saves makes it hard to compare.
- Running mastering before cleanup can amplify noise.

## Tips
- Save each stage as a separate version to compare easily.

## TODO
- Add a "fast lane" workflow for batch mastering.
