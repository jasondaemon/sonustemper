# EQ

## What it does
EQ is a soundboard‑style multi‑band EQ with live spectrum, curve editor, and voice controls (de‑esser, vocal smooth, de‑harsh) applied before EQ.

## When to use it
- Tone shaping with a familiar channel‑strip layout.
- Quick vocal cleanup before or after AI cleanup.

## Step-by-step
1) Load a track from the Library.
2) Use the 7‑band template (HPF, shelves, mids).
3) Drag handles on the canvas to adjust frequency and gain.
4) Enable Voice Controls as needed (use Listen to hunt sibilance).
5) Save an EQ’d copy to create a new version.

## Common pitfalls
- If Listen is on, you are hearing a band‑solo preview, not full mix.
- If nothing changes, confirm a band is enabled and not bypassed.

## Tips
- Use HPF to clean rumble; LPF for harsh top‑end.
- Keep gains small and compare in Compare.

## TODO
- Add keyboard shortcuts for band selection and delete.
