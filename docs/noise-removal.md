# Noise Removal

## What it does
Noise Removal isolates and reduces unwanted noise using presets or a marquee selection. It supports previewing solo noise vs filtered song and saves versioned outputs.

## When to use it
- Hiss, hum, and background noise cleanup.
- Targeted cleanup in specific time regions.

## Step-by-step
1) Select a song.
2) Choose either Preset Noise Removal (full song) or Selected Noise Removal (marquee).
3) Preview Solo Noise or Filtered Song.
4) Save the cleaned song (creates a new version).
5) Save a preset from a marquee selection when needed.

## Common pitfalls
- If no selection exists, "Apply to Selection" does nothing.
- If preview is silent, check that selection bounds are valid.

## Tips
- Use Preset workflow for quick global cleanup.
- Use Selected workflow for tight noise regions.

## TODO
- Add examples of common preset configurations.
