# Preset Management

## What it does
Preset Management lets you create and manage voicings, profiles, and noise presets. Presets are stored on disk and appear across utilities.

## When to use it
- Create voicing/profile from reference audio.
- Manage user presets for mastering and noise removal.

## Step-by-step
1) Open Preset Management.
2) Use "Create From Reference Audio" for voicing/profile.
3) Upload or delete presets as needed.
4) Confirm presets appear in Mastering and Noise Removal.

## Common pitfalls
- If presets do not show, check preset directory paths and UI preset root.
- If generation reports success but lists are empty, reload the preset list.

## Tips
- Keep preset names consistent for easier selection.

## TODO
- Document preset file formats and schema.
